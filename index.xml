      <title>Moving from Jekyll to blogdown</title>

      <description>Given the rate at which I&amp;rsquo;m posting new content these days&amp;ndash;3 posts in 2017, 2 in 2018, 1 in 2019&amp;ndash;my blog appears to slowly be becoming a blog about moving from one blogging engine to another.
Behind the scenes, at some point in early 2019 (it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell), I started moving the site from Jekyll to R&amp;rsquo;s blogdown, which uses the Hugo static site generator.
Why?
Reason number 1, which spurred this whole transition idea, is that GitHub keeps alerting me to security vulnerabilities in the blog dependencies, a lot of which are related to the theme I was using.</description>

      <description>This is more of a test post. It’s created from an Rmarkdown file that scrapes presidential rankings from Wikipedia for the chart below. Incidentally, I’m updating this from an earlier April version the morning after Trump was impeached back in the US by the House.</description>

      <description>The latest version of the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) data, version 8, has historical data back to 1789, in addition to updated data for 2017. The full dataset is massive, but at the top level there are a handful of index variables capturing various facets of &amp;ldquo;democraci-ness&amp;rdquo;. The chart below shows the polyarchy index for all countries from 1789 to 2017. Click to zoom.
You may notice a clump of new countries in 1900.</description>

      <description>(Last updated on 2018-06-22 with pointilist version and reference to stochastic rounding.)
There was a little war of maps after the 2016 election. A thematic map of the election results with states colored red or blue based on where the plurality of votes went, like this one from Politico, visually overstates the Republican vote share. This is even more evident with a map at the county level (example from here), which shows a sea of red containing scattered islands of a blue archipelago.</description>

      <description>The map below shows the age of the world&amp;rsquo;s state leaders on 12 December 2017.
The mean age is around 62 years, ranging from 31.5 year old Sebastian Kurz in Austria&amp;mdash;whose party won the last legislative elections and is in the process of forming a government&amp;mdash;to 91.5 year old President Essebi in Tunisia.
The data come from the REIGN leader data, which in part builds on and updates the Archigos leader data, a dataset of the leaders of the world&amp;rsquo;s independent states from 1875 on.</description>

      <title>Local elections in Estonia</title>

      <description>About a month ago, on October 15th, Estonia held local elections for 79 municipalities. Insofar as they take place around the midpoint between national elections&amp;ndash;the next are in 2019&amp;ndash;the local elections are somewhat of a bellwether, like the US mid-term elections are. Accordingly a lot of the coverage in Estonia has focused on national-level results for the five major parties.
For anyone outside of Estonia, it is 2017 and the burning question of course is how well the local right-wing populists did.</description>

      <description>Forecasts Models and accuracy Accuracy Data Covariates Coups Missing data Why did we not include…? Parting thoughts This posts provides some background for the coup forecasts article Mike Ward and I published in the Washington Posts’ Monkey Cage.
Coup attempts, even if they fail, as the events in Turkey since July 2016 have shown, can have a major impact on a country. And, as some of the reactions to the Turkey coup attempt have reiterated, they often seem to come as a surprise.</description>

      <description>In the wake of the Trump victory surprise, and the potential implications for NATO, I stumbled upon a Eurobarometer question that asks people how they feel about the prospect of an EU Army:
Thinking about the future of the EU, please tell me whether you are in favour or opposed to the following statement: the creation of an EU army.
Turns out the Eurobarometer has been asking that question for quite some time, which was the first surprising thing.</description>

      <description>One of my first assignments as a research assistant in graduate school was to create and work with a directed dyadic refugees and migration dataset. This was in about 2006. The data were big-ish, maybe a 100 MB in some incarnation, so my advisor gave me a CD and probably some sensible instructions on what I was supposed to do. Off I went to the grad computer lab, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t own a laptop then.</description>

      <description>I moved my home page and blog from Wordpress to Jekyll over the past week, thanks to a small break in regular work. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Wordpress.com since 2011, when I started blogging. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what led me back then to choose Wordpress, but overall, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been unhappy with it. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to set up, and at some point it became possible to write posts in Markdown. Comments work out of the box.</description>

      <title>3d surface plots of GDP vs. event data</title>
      <link>https://andybeger.com/blog/3d-surface-plots/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;wrote a post&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; about how the patterns by which data for cross-national datasets observed over multiple periods, e.g. with country-year or country-month observations, vary is important for modeling and prediction. Here is another way to visualize why this is the case using 3-d surface plots made with &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Plotly&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://andybeger.com/img/2016/gdp-logged.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andybeger.com/img/2016/gdp-logged.png&#34; alt=&#34;3d surface plot of logged GDP per capita&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot shows logged GDP per capita for &amp;gt;150 countries from 1995 to 2013. This is about the time period we cover in our data for &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;forecasting irregular leadership changes&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. Countries are sorted by GDP for the last year with data, which is why the near edge of the plot is smoother than the far end. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious that there are some changes within countries and at rates that differ from other countries, but still most of the variation is between countries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When forecasting goes wrong (maybe): Yemen</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Ward Lab blog&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; a few weeks ago:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months we have worked on regularly updating our irregular leadership change models and forecasts in order to provide monthly 6-month ahead forecasts of the probability of irregular leadership change in a large number of countries&amp;ndash;but excluding the US&amp;ndash;worldwide. Part of that effort has been the occasional glance back at our previous predictions, and particularly more in-depth examinations for notable cases that we missed or got right, to see whether we can improve our modeling as a result. This note is one of these glances back: a postmortem of our Yemen predictions for the first half of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This post first appeared at Predictive Heuristics.
Alexander Noyes and Sebastian Elischer wrote about good coups on Monkey Cage a few weeks ago, in the shadow of fallout from the LaCour revelations. Good coups namely are those that lead to democratization, rather than outcomes one might more commonly associate with coups, like military rule, dictatorship, or instability. Elischer, although on the whole less optimistic about good coups than Noyes, writes:</description>

      <title>A quick look at the public ICEWS data</title>

      <description>The ICEWS data, including the underlying raw event data as well as some aggregations, were quietly posted on Dataverse the Friday before last. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with the ICEWS data for several years now, first when I was working on on the ICEWS package&amp;ndash;we deliver updated monthly forecasts for the ICEWS events of interest (EOIs) once a month&amp;ndash;and more recently for the [irregular leadership change forecasting project](http://andybeger.com/2014/05/23/the-thailand-coup-and-some-recent- forecasting-work/). The public data are formatted differently from the data I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with, so most of the code I have lying around is not that useful, but in going through the public data I did recreate a short overview that is nowhere near as complete as David Masad&amp;rsquo;s first look (using Python), and some code that might be useful for getting started in R.</description>

      <description>Update 2016-06: there&amp;rsquo;s a PDF of this now, at http://ssrn.com/abstract=2765419
ROC curves are a fairly standard way to evaluate model fit with binary outcomes, like (civil) war onset. I would be willing to bet that most if not all quantitative political scientists know what they are and how to construct one. Unlike simpler fit statistics like accuracy or percentage reduction in error (PRE), they do not depend on the particular threshold value used to divide probabilistic predictions into binary predictions, and thus give a better sense of the tradeoff between true and false positives inherent in any probabilistic model.</description>

      <title>Archigos leader turnovers by regime</title>

      <description>This post is about the Archigos data, which you can find here.
Political scientists, and maybe historians as well, are familiar with coups, rebellions, and mass protests as distinct phenomena that lead to the fall of regimes occasionally. Another way to view these events is from the perspective of state leaders, and how these events affect transitions between political leaders. Selectorate theory does this by considering the sets of people within a regime that a leader must rely on to remain in power, and how their relative sizes shape behavior.</description>

Nobody in their right mind would think that the chances of civil war in Denmark and Mauritania are the same. One is a well-established democracy with a GDP of $38,000 per person and which ranks in the top 10 by Human Development Index (HDI), while the other is a fledgling republic in which the current President gained power through a military coup, with a GDP of $2,000 per person and near the bottom of the HDI rankings.</description>

      <description>Shiny is a web application framework that lets you create interactive websites representing R data visualization and analysis. The gallery has some nice examples, and it looks like a great way to make R more accessible without having to know things like JavaScript or d3. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in trying my hand at it and it seems like a great way to visualize the models underlying the forecasts I work on in Ward Lab as well as the event data on which they are in part based.</description>

      <description>This first appeared on Predictive Heuristics, my employer&amp;rsquo;s blog.
Improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, were extensively used during the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, causing half of all US and coalition casualties despite increasingly sophisticated countermeasures. Although both of these wars have come to a close, it is unlikely that the threat of IEDs will disappear. If anything, their success implies that US and European forces are more likely to face them in similar future conflicts.</description>

This morning (East Coast time), the Thai military staged a coup against the caretaker government that had been in power for the past several weeks, after months of protests and political turmoil directed at the government of Yingluck Shinawatra, who herself had been ordered to resign on 7 May by the judiciary.</description>

Somebody emailed me about how to do the reverse: the person had a list of villages in France along with the population in 2010, and wanted to find which administrative unit each village was located in. The problem boils down to associating points, the village coordinates, with polygons, the administrative division which they are a part of.</description>

After more than half a decade at this, it has finally dawned upon me that instead of downloading the Correlates of War state system membership table, or the Gleditsch and Ward refinement of it, every time I wonder what country &amp;ldquo;338&amp;rdquo; is, it might be easier to upload them to Google:</description>

      <description>If you had to take a look at the chart below, what would you say about the overall trend in US defense spending? There&amp;rsquo;s a bump fairly early on for World War 2, but otherwise it seems to generally increase over time. I&amp;rsquo;m actually surprised to see that we spend more, in terms of constant US dollars, today than we did at the height of the Korean War, and in fact at any point in US history save World War 2.</description>

The short version:
Here is some R code to create arbitrary country-year or country-month data sets reflecting the Gleditsch and Ward or COW state system membership lists, using the cshapes R package.</description>

In 2013, my toolbox looks like this:
Python for text processing and miscellaneous scripting; Ruby on Rails/JavaScript for web development, except for an occasional date with Django or Flask (Python frameworks); Python (NumPy/SciPy) for numerical computing; Python (Neurosynth, NiPy etc.) for neuroimaging data analysis; Python (NumPy/SciPy/pandas/statsmodels) for statistical analysis; Python (MatPlotLib) for plotting and visualization, except for web-based visualizations (JavaScript/d3.</description>

      <description>I work as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Ward Lab here at Duke University. The Lab currently consists of Mike Ward, me, and a group of very smart graduate students. There are a lot of exciting projects within the lab, like ICEWS and other work for the US government, but also a broader set of projects by our lab members. One of the things we wanted to do this semester is to publicize this work a little bit more, and to this end we&amp;rsquo;re taking a new blog live today: Predictive Heuristics.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, for whatever reason, you want to plot something fast. Last week I had some coordinates associated with event data that I was hoping were all from Egypt. But the coordinates were for locations that are only indirectly associated with the events I had, so I wanted to do a quick plot to check. The ggmap package in R makes that pretty easy.
First, some libraries we will need, and the coordinates.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve set up both a PostgreSQL and MySQL server to host databases related to some of our projects in the Ward Lab. I should note that I have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, and this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with databases and how to get them working. It&amp;rsquo;s been a very humbling experience, although in the end, we now have two different databases that can be accessed remotely from a laptop through R or other tools like Quantum GIS:</description>

Country names to COW [.do] Do-file that creates COW country codes for a dataset that only has country names in it. The file does not take the current year of an observation into account, and does not adjust for state membership (e.g. there was no unified Germany between 1946 and 1989).</description>

      <description>The problem: you have data that includes the name of a village or city in which something happened, but not coordinates for that village or city. This seems to be a pretty common problem, or at least I&amp;rsquo;ve come across it a few times.
The (or a) solution is to look up the city names with the GeoNames database. Their website has a search feature and with that it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to figure out the coordinates for a city or village name.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with SIGACT data (military significant activities reports) all day as part of a research project. When you are dealing with thousands of them, it is easy to trivialize and forget the amount of human suffering encapsulated in each event (and those we don&amp;rsquo;t hear about).
Yesterday, in Afghanistan, 2nd Lieutenant Justin Sisson was among the dead in a suicide bombing that killed another NATO soldier and 9 children.</description>

      <description>Someone sent around a link this morning to data on grade inflation at Duke, which shows a table of average GPAs for undergraduates from 1932 on. Looking at the table you can sort of get a sense of when GPA&amp;rsquo;s really started increasing (the &amp;rsquo;60s), but it would be nicer to just plot them:
Or to plot the year over year change in average GPA, with some missing values interpolated:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago we were asked to teach the basics of (interpreting) duration models to a group of consumers without using any math. When I learned about this it involved a lot of math and Stata, and when you look around the web it&amp;rsquo;s usually presented similarly. So this was a bit of a challenge.
A nice thing about duration analysis though is that a lot of the key concepts are already explicitly graphical, like survival curves (wikipedia) and hazard rates.</description>

      <description>Will Moore, Kentaro Fukumoto, and I have been working on a random walk negative binomial model for time-series of counts, based on earlier work by Kentaro on a negative binomial integrated (NB I(1)) model. We just presented a related poster in which we look at monthly civilian deaths in Iraq at Peace Science in Savannah, Georgia. Here is the actual pdf poster (it&amp;rsquo;s a big file, be warned), but the basic point is that ARIMA or classical count-models are not a good way to deal with time-series of counts, like monthly deaths in a conflict, and that we have a tested model for non-stationary counts that has some attractive features.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I produced some thematic maps of Bosnia (paper) using maptools and other packages in R, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t include scales or a north arrow. It sounds simple and sp has functions for doing those things, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to work well with my maps. Here is a basic map of Bosnia&amp;rsquo;s pre-war municipalities:

      <description>The Iraq Body Count project collects reports of civilian deaths, and makes their event data publicly available. Each event gives the date, location, description and civilian deaths associated with an incident. Looking at a few examples [1, 2, 3], you can see that while the data values for the date and deaths are straightforward, the place values get a little bit complicated. I&amp;rsquo;m looking for the province in which incidents occurred, so the challenge is to associate each place value with a province.</description>

      <description>In 1991 a census was conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which then was still part of the disintegrating federal state of Yugoslavia. Bosnia was the most diverse republic in the former Yugoslavia, with significant populations of Bosnian Muslims (or Bosniaks, 43 percent), Serbs (31 percent), Croats (17 percent), and others. Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats were more or less well-established identities with historical roots. Unlike in most multiethnic countries however, the census respondents also had the option to identify themselves as Yugoslavs, rather than a particular ethnic or national group.</description>

      <description>For the most part I don&amp;rsquo;t do things that are computationally so intensive that I can&amp;rsquo;t run them on my work desktop. There have been a few times however where I ran simulations or bootstrapped models, and now Bayesian models with MCMC, that take a while to run. One solution has been to run things on FSU&amp;rsquo;s high performance computing cluster. It takes a little bit of effort, for someone without a background in computer science or programming like me, and it is inconvenient in several ways.</description>

      <description>President Obama announced today that U.S. troops will leave Iraq by the end of 2011. What has the 9 year long war accomplished?
Iraq is a democracy, sort of. Although it has a parliament, prime minister, elections and that sort of stuff, it is also pretty corrupt. There has not yet been a peaceful transition of power, a key feature of democracy, as prime minister al-Maliki was reelected to a second term in a troubled election in 2010.</description>

      <description>A few months ago the Defense Science Board Task Force on Defense Intelligence released a report on Counterinsurgency (COIN) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Operations (pdf). Among its recommandations is that:
the government generally should increase investment in social science disciplines (anthropology, ethnography, human geography, sociology, social-psychology, political science, and economics) to inform a whole-of-government approach to understanding local cultures and customs and to support future COIN campaigns.
and the report notes that:</description>

Starting with the protests on National Police Day, January 25th, 2011, the Egyptian people went to the streets, largely peacefully, and removed Mubarak from power. Now the Egyptian military, hesitant, will have to get involved in running the country.</description>

Not knowing, I was on my way to death from cancer at the time. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t positive.
In retrospect I have to also admit even more how much more difficult the combat arms soldiers and officers have it. My life was plush in comparison.</description>

In many circumstances political scientists study binary dependent variables that have been measured with bias. For example, in surveys the strategic interests of actors can lead them to misrepresent an attitude or behavior to the surveyor in a non-random fashion. Data on terror or torture that are coded using media reports likely suffer from a similar bias related to factors such as freedom of the press in a country.</description>

      <description>Another set of notes from when I was TA for our Advanced Quantitative Methods course with Prof. Matt Golder in 2008. The notes for Programming MLE models in Stata (pdf) walk you through how to recreate your own logit regression command and ado files for Stata, as well as how to use simulations to check your model. Here are also the associated ado and do files.
The notes are closely based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Stata (2006, see full citation in the notes), which is definitely worth it if you are considering writing your own MLE commands in Stata.</description>

This dates back to work I did in 2008, but some people seem to find it useful:
At the beginning of the Yugoslav civil wars, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) consisted of 109 municipalities. Finding free geographic layers with those municipal boundaries was difficult so I recreated them from National Geophysical Data Center Coastline Extractor, using World Data Bank II. Municipality names and demographic information come from the 1991 Yugoslav census courtesy wikipedia.</description>
