      <title>When forecasting goes wrong (maybe): Yemen</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;http://predictiveheuristics.com/2015/08/10/yemen-investigation/&#34;&gt;Ward Lab blog&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months we have worked on regularly updating our irregular leadership change models and forecasts in order to provide monthly 6-month ahead forecasts of the probability of irregular leadership change in a large number of countries&amp;ndash;but excluding the US&amp;ndash;worldwide. Part of that effort has been the occasional glance back at our previous predictions, and particularly more in-depth examinations for notable cases that we missed or got right, to see whether we can improve our modeling as a result. This note is one of these glances back: a postmortem of our Yemen predictions for the first half of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Good coup, bad coup</title>

      <description>This post first appeared at Predictive Heuristics.
Alexander Noyes and Sebastian Elischer wrote about good coups on Monkey Cage a few weeks ago, in the shadow of fallout from the LaCour revelations. Good coups namely are those that lead to democratization, rather than outcomes one might more commonly associate with coups, like military rule, dictatorship, or instability. Elischer, although on the whole less optimistic about good coups than Noyes, writes:</description>

      <title>A quick look at the public ICEWS data</title>

      <description>The ICEWS data, including the underlying raw event data as well as some aggregations, were quietly posted on Dataverse the Friday before last. I&#39;ve worked with the ICEWS data for several years now, first when I was working on on the ICEWS package&amp;ndash;we deliver updated monthly forecasts for the ICEWS events of interest (EOIs) once a month&amp;ndash;and more recently for the [irregular leadership change forecasting project](http://andybeger.com/2014/05/23/the-thailand-coup-and-some-recent- forecasting-work/). The public data are formatted differently from the data I&#39;ve worked with, so most of the code I have lying around is not that useful, but in going through the public data I did recreate a short overview that is nowhere near as complete as David Masad&amp;lsquo;s first look (using Python), and some code that might be useful for getting started in R.</description>

      <title>Precision-recall curves</title>

      <description>Update 2016-06: there&#39;s a PDF of this now, at http://ssrn.com/abstract=2765419
 ROC curves are a fairly standard way to evaluate model fit with binary outcomes, like (civil) war onset. I would be willing to bet that most if not all quantitative political scientists know what they are and how to construct one. Unlike simpler fit statistics like accuracy or percentage reduction in error (PRE), they do not depend on the particular threshold value used to divide probabilistic predictions into binary predictions, and thus give a better sense of the tradeoff between true and false positives inherent in any probabilistic model.</description>

      <description>I blogged earlier at Predictive Heuristics about the Thailand coup and some forecasting work I&#39;ve recently been part of:
 This morning (East Coast time), the Thai military staged a coup against the caretaker government that had been in power for the past several weeks, after months of protests and political turmoil directed at the government of Yingluck Shinawatra, who herself had been ordered to resign on 7 May by the judiciary.</description>

      <title>Random walk negative binomial model for persistent count series.</title>

      <description>Will Moore, Kentaro Fukumoto, and I have been working on a random walk negative binomial model for time-series of counts, based on earlier work by Kentaro on a negative binomial integrated (NB I(1)) model. We just presented a related poster in which we look at monthly civilian deaths in Iraq at Peace Science in Savannah, Georgia. Here is the actual pdf poster (it&#39;s a big file, be warned), but the basic point is that ARIMA or classical count-models are not a good way to deal with time-series of counts, like monthly deaths in a conflict, and that we have a tested model for non-stationary counts that has some attractive features.</description>
