      <description>A few weeks ago weÂ were asked to teach the basics of (interpreting) duration models to a group of consumers without using any math. When I learned about this it involved a lot of math and Stata, and when you look around the web it&amp;rsquo;s usually presented similarly. So this was a bit of a challenge.
A nice thing about duration analysis though is that a lot of the key concepts are already explicitly graphical, like survival curves (wikipedia) and hazard rates.</description>
