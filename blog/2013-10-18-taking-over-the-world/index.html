        <content>
          <p>I work as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="http://mdwardlab.com">Ward Lab</a> here at Duke University. The Lab currently consists of Mike Ward, me, and a <a href="http://mdwardlab.com/members">group of very smart graduate students</a>. There are a lot of exciting projects within the lab, like ICEWS and other work for the US government, but also a broader set of projects by our lab members. One of the things we wanted to do this semester is to publicize this work a little bit more, and to this end we&rsquo;re taking a new blog live today: <a href="http://www.predictiveheuristics.com">Predictive Heuristics</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is to have an outlet in which the lab as a whole and the people in it can present work in progress or other lab projects that might be of interest to what we call the predictive heuristics community: researchers and analysts who are using data and statistical methods to develop tools that aid real-world decisions-making and policy. To the extent that my own blog and career has an identity&mdash;military intelligence and statistical methods&mdash;that fits well with what I&rsquo;m (sort of) trying to do. I think it will also be a nice way to keep people who are interested in ICEWS (which we are trying to make publicly available in some form) and other lab projects updated.</p>
<p>In any case, we&rsquo;re going to have an interesting series of topics lined up. Although the lab as a whole is centered on predicting political conflict, we have people who are pursuing a pretty broad range of interests, from party and coalition politics through more traditional inter-state dynamics to imputation and other methods. Some of the posts we have coming up are on:</p>
<ul>
<li>comparing the ICEWS and GDELT event data,</li>
<li>our collaboration with the <a href="http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/">Good Judgment</a> project,</li>
<li>latent space modeling of Germany&rsquo;s parties,</li>
<li>details of our global conflict forecasting R packages, ICEWS and CRISP.</li>
</ul>
