        <h1>The Iraq War, 2003 to 2011</h1>
        
        <content>
          <p>President Obama announced today that U.S. troops will leave Iraq by the end of 2011. What has the 9 year long war accomplished?</p>
<p>Iraq is a democracy, sort of. Although it has a parliament, prime minister, elections and that sort of stuff, it is also pretty corrupt. There has not yet been a peaceful transition of power, a key feature of democracy, as prime minister al-Maliki was reelected to a second term in a troubled election in 2010. It has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity_data_series">polity score</a>  of <a href="http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/irq2.htm">3</a> on a scale from -10 to 10, which doesn&rsquo;t quite qualify it as a democracy in common usage. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.eiu.com/Handlers/WhitepaperHandler.ashx?fi=Democracy_Index_2010_Web.pdf&amp;mode=wp">Democracy Index 2010</a> it is a hybrid regime just a tad above authoritarianism and according to Freedom House it is <a href="http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2011&amp;country=8058">not free</a>.</p>
<p>In 9 years of war, 111,000+ civilian deaths (<a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/">Iraq Body Count</a>), and taking into account excess mortality maybe even upwards of 1 million (<a href="http://www.opinion.co.uk/Newsroom_details.aspx?NewsId=120">Opinion Research Business survey</a>) out of a population of 31 million. The Iraq Body Count data is based on press reports of violent deaths and actual deaths are most likely higher. But basically around 1 out of every 50 was killed.</p>
<p>Upwards of 15,00o Iraq Security Forces deaths and around 24,000 insurgent deaths (<a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/numbers/warlogs/">Iraq War Logs summary at IBC</a>).</p>
<p>About 4,800 U.S. and coalition deaths (<a href="http://icasualties.org/Iraq/Index.aspx">iCasualties.org</a>) and 32,000 U.S. wounded (<a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/casualty.pdf">DoD</a>). Also, direct cost of <a href="http://costofwar.com/en/">$800 billion or so</a>. But since most of that was financed through debt, the actual cost will probably end up in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/07/AR2008030702846.html">low trillions</a>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Iraq has surpassed it&rsquo;s pre-war <a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=iz&amp;v=67">GDP per capita</a>, even during the war. But then, oil prices have risen as well and most of Iraq&rsquo;s economy is based on oil.</p>
<p>Weapons of mass destruction. Never mind.</p>
