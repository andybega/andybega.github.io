## Coup forecasts

_(This is not a paid project, although with internal support from PH for the 2020 forecasts)_

Inspired by Jay Ulfelder's coup forecasts from 2012 - 2015, I've tried at various points since then to also provide some coup forecasts as a public good, although not successful for all years (I'm lazy, what can I say, and I've learned that I turn into a data pedant when doing these).

<h2 id="hfc-sage">HFC-SAGE</h2>
<p>IARPA&rsquo;s Hybrid Forecasting Competition (HFC), <a href="https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/hfc">in their own words</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The HFC program seeks to develop and test hybrid geopolitical forecasting systems. These systems will integrate human and machine forecasting components to create maximally accurate, flexible, and scalable forecasting capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea essentially was to study how one can combine human forecasts from a Good Judgment-style platform with machine-generated forecasts to answer questions like. We were part of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTg8eA-8zrAhXkAhAIHZRtAAQQFjABegQIAxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fviterbischool.usc.edu%2Fnews%2F2017%2F10%2Fusc-isi-leads-iarpa-contract-developing-hybrid-forecasting-systems%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw16-ypTB_zqSL0m4VL8ioPI">USC ISI&rsquo;s SAGE team</a>. My specific contribution was an automated forecasting system that used data provided by a corresponding ISI data collection platform in combination with some parsing logic to &ldquo;understand&rdquo; a multinomial question in order to apply univariate time-series models and turn them into probabilistic forecasts for the answer options. About half of the questions overall were at least in principle amenable to a univariate time-series based solution, and of those the system covered 2/3rds, with an overall accuracy that for the optimal models approached the best combination of human forecasts.</p>

Modeling and predicting the occurrence of IED events in Afghanistan at a high resolution of ~1km^2 grid cell-day units. Eventually expanded to modeling mines in Colombia, with estimates of the probability that province is mine free or not mine free.

<h2 id="w-icews">W-ICEWS</h2>
<p>W-ICEWS is a global crisis monitoring and forecasting system (<a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/research-labs/advanced-technology-labs/icews.html">here&rsquo;s the Lockheed-Martin page on this</a>). A lot of people are familiar with the ICEWS event data that was generated as part of this project, but there was actually a forecasting component for five different forms of crises as well. I joined Duke at the tail end of the project, when the forecasting component was mostly already in place, and helped a bit with maintaining and improving it. This included improvements to the R package that was used to deliver monthly forecast updates, as well as to the general monthly forecast update pipeline. I also setup and maintained a MySQL server for lab use to host the raw ICEWS event data, which consists of 70+ database tables totalling 200GB at the time.</p>
