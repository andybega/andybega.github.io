      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;http://predictiveheuristics.com/2015/08/10/yemen-investigation/&#34;&gt;Ward Lab blog&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months we have worked on regularly updating our irregular leadership change models and forecasts in order to provide monthly 6-month ahead forecasts of the probability of irregular leadership change in a large number of countries&amp;ndash;but excluding the US&amp;ndash;worldwide. Part of that effort has been the occasional glance back at our previous predictions, and particularly more in-depth examinations for notable cases that we missed or got right, to see whether we can improve our modeling as a result. This note is one of these glances back: a postmortem of our Yemen predictions for the first half of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I blogged earlier at Predictive Heuristics about the Thailand coup and some forecasting work I&#39;ve recently been part of:
 This morning (East Coast time), the Thai military staged a coup against the caretaker government that had been in power for the past several weeks, after months of protests and political turmoil directed at the government of Yingluck Shinawatra, who herself had been ordered to resign on 7 May by the judiciary.</description>
