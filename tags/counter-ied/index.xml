      <description>This first appeared on Predictive Heuristics, my employer&amp;rsquo;s blog.&#xA;Improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, were extensively used during the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, causing half of all US and coalition casualties despite increasingly sophisticated countermeasures. Although both of these wars have come to a close, it is unlikely that the threat of IEDs will disappear. If anything, their success implies that US and European forces are more likely to face them in similar future conflicts.</description>

      <description>A long time ago, in a place far away, I wrote this (pdf). Random thoughts on counter-IED in northern Iraq, and gripes about living there.&#xA;Not knowing, I was on my way to death from cancer at the time. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t positive.&#xA;In retrospect I have to also admit even more how much more difficult the combat arms soldiers and officers have it. My life was plush in comparison.</description>
