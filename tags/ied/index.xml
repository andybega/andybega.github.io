      <description>This first appeared on Predictive Heuristics, my employer&amp;rsquo;s blog.
Improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, were extensively used during the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, causing half of all US and coalition casualties despite increasingly sophisticated countermeasures.

Yesterday, in Afghanistan, 2nd Lieutenant Justin Sisson was among the dead in a suicide bombing that killed another NATO soldier and 9 children.</description>
