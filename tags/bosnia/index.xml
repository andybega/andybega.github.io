      <description>A few months ago I produced some thematic maps of Bosnia (paper) using maptools and other packages in R, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t include scales or a north arrow. It sounds simple and sp has functions for doing those things, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to work well with my maps. Here is a basic map of Bosnia&amp;rsquo;s pre-war municipalities:

Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats were more or less well-established identities with historical roots. Unlike in most multiethnic countries however, the census respondents also had the option to identify themselves as Yugoslavs, rather than a particular ethnic or national group.</description>
