      <description>The latest version of the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) data, version 8, has historical data back to 1789, in addition to updated data for 2017. The full dataset is massive, but at the top level there are a handful of index variables capturing various facets of &amp;ldquo;democraci-ness&amp;rdquo;. The chart below shows the polyarchy index for all countries from 1789 to 2017. Click to zoom.
You may notice a clump of new countries in 1900.</description>

      <description>(Last updated on 2018-06-22 with pointilist version and reference to stochastic rounding.)
There was a little war of maps after the 2016 election. A thematic map of the election results with states colored red or blue based on where the plurality of votes went, like this one from Politico, visually overstates the Republican vote share. This is even more evident with a map at the county level (example from here), which shows a sea of red containing scattered islands of a blue archipelago.</description>
