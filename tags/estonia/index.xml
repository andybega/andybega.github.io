      <description>About a month ago, on October 15th, Estonia held local elections for 79 municipalities. Insofar as they take place around the midpoint between national elections&amp;ndash;the next are in 2019&amp;ndash;the local elections are somewhat of a bellwether, like the US mid-term elections are. Accordingly a lot of the coverage in Estonia has focused on national-level results for the five major parties.
For anyone outside of Estonia, it is 2017 and the burning question of course is how well the local right-wing populists did.</description>
