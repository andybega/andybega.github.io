      <description>The latest version of the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) data, version 8, has historical data back to 1789, in addition to updated data for 2017. The full dataset is massive, but at the top level there are a handful of index variables capturing various facets of &amp;ldquo;democraci-ness&amp;rdquo;. The chart below shows the polyarchy index for all countries from 1789 to 2017. Click to zoom.

      <description>In 2003 we invaded Iraq with the hope that people would cheer in the streets. They didn&amp;rsquo;t. We occupied the country anyways and our presences was and generally is hated by the people.
Starting with the protests on National Police Day, January 25th, 2011, the Egyptian people went to the streets, largely peacefully, and removed Mubarak from power. Now the Egyptian military, hesitant, will have to get involved in running the country.</description>
