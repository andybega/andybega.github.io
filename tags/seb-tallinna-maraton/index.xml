      <description>Shiny is a web application framework that lets you create interactive websites representing R data visualization and analysis. The gallery has some nice examples, and it looks like a great way to make R more accessible without having to know things like JavaScript or d3. I&#39;ve been in trying my hand at it and it seems like a great way to visualize the models underlying the forecasts I work on in Ward Lab as well as the event data on which they are in part based.</description>
