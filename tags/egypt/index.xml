      <description>In 2003 we invaded Iraq with the hope that people would cheer in the streets. They didn&amp;rsquo;t. We occupied the country anyways and our presences was and generally is hated by the people.&#xA;Starting with the protests on National Police Day, January 25th, 2011, the Egyptian people went to the streets, largely peacefully, and removed Mubarak from power. Now the Egyptian military, hesitant, will have to get involved in running the country.</description>
