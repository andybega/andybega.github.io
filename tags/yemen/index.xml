      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Ward Lab blog&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; a few weeks ago:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months we have worked on regularly updating our irregular leadership change models and forecasts in order to provide monthly 6-month ahead forecasts of the probability of irregular leadership change in a large number of countries&amp;ndash;but excluding the US&amp;ndash;worldwide. Part of that effort has been the occasional glance back at our previous predictions, and particularly more in-depth examinations for notable cases that we missed or got right, to see whether we can improve our modeling as a result. This note is one of these glances back: a postmortem of our Yemen predictions for the first half of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
